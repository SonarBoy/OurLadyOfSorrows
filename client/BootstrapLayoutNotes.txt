Bootstrap Layout Notes:

Think designing for the mobile first.

- To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the viewport meta tag to your <head>.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

- You can disable these capabilities by adding user-scalable=no
- This can make your site feel more like a native application.

- The following is the basic styling of bootstrap:

    Set background-color: #fff; on the body
    Use the @font-family-base, @font-size-base, and @line-height-base attributes as our typographic base
    Set the global link color via @link-color and apply link underlines only on :hover

Containers
- bootstrap wraps elements in a container to be able to house it in their grid system
<div class="container"> = fixed width container
<div class="container-fluid"> = container that spans the entire viewport


GRID SYSTEM!!!!
- Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales 
up to 12 coloums as the device or viewport size increases. 

- Rows must be placed within a .container or .container-fluid for proper alignment and padding.
- Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns. or each row is a horizontal group of a columns
- Content should be placed within columns and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
- Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts.
- Columns create gutters or gaps in content via padding. The padding is ofset in rows for the first
  and last column via negative margin on .rows.
- Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span.
  Example three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4
- If more than 12 colmns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit
  wrap into a new line.
- Grid classes apply to devices with screen widths greated than or equal to the breakpoint size and 
  override grid classes targeted at smaller devices. There fore applying any .col-md-* class to an element
  will not only affect its styling on medium devices but also on large devices if a .col-lg-* class is not present


/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-sm-min) { ... }

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-md-min) { ... }

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: @screen-lg-min) { ... }
